This company is currently selling products physically. Therefore they are lacking in selling products online. They also had mistakes in their manual system, such as less accuracy in company documents. Because of that, the company was proposed to develop an online shopping system for their company. We decided to develop this using MERN stack technology. This is the Trending technology in the industry right now. Since this is an online system the faults that they had was reduced. After developing this system, they could be able to sell more products and gain more income by using this system.</p>
